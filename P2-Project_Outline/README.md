## Submission Instructions

### Overview
As a write I've always looked for an app where I can freely share and archive my writing with others, seeking out critisim no matter how kind or critial it is from others. With this ambition I've chosen to create an app called 'Writer's Paradise' for the time being, where individuals can do just that at their leisure from their phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer. Not only that, but also allowing a space where communities with different passions for differ genres and types of writing can flourish, and possibly even be recognized by others - publisher or not. The application at its core is meant to allow writers the ease of being able to engage in their hobby no matter the time, place, or whether or not there is a valid internet connection as well. 

### Features
User login:Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. 

Search: Users will be able to searchh posted works, either by keyword, tags, or genre - so long as they are made public.

Create Dynamic Profiles: Users will be able to create personalized profiles for themselves, which can be made private or public.

Create Post: Users will be able to post their stories to their profiles and recent works pages with the ability to add the appropriate tags and genre categories. 

Chatrooms: Users will be able to create chatrooms to actively talk and interact with other writers on the site. 

### Technologies
HTML5
Javascript
jQuery
Bootstrap
MySQL

### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll need to learn how to create a chat functionality in the long-term - but short-term I'll need to learn how to better manage data, figure out other viable security options so there's more than one layer of it within the code, designing a sleek and eye-catching interface using Bootstrap that is functional on the resolution of all devices.
